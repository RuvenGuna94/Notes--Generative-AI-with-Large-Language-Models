# Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)

## Overview
- Combines reinforcement learning (RL) with human feedback data.
- Aligns outputs with human preferences, ensuring relevance and usefulness.
- Helps minimize harmful outputs by training the model to acknowledge limitations and avoid toxic content.

## Applications
- Personalization of large language models (LLMs):
  - Models learn individual user preferences through continuous feedback.
  - Potential for personalized AI assistants and individualized learning plans.
