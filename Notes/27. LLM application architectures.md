1. **Infrastructure Layer**:
   - Provides the foundation for compute, storage, and networking.
   - Can be on-premises or cloud-based (on-demand, pay-as-you-go).
   - Must be scalable to meet real-time or near-real-time inference needs.

2. **Language Models**:
   - Includes foundation models and task-specific fine-tuned models.
   - Deployed on suitable infrastructure tailored to your latency and resource needs.

3. **External Data Integration**:
   - Use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to fetch information from external sources.
   - Augments the model's static context window for more dynamic and relevant completions.

4. **Storage and Feedback Mechanisms**:
   - Capture and store session data for:
     - Contextual augmentation.
     - Fine-tuning, alignment, and evaluation.
   - Gather user feedback to iteratively improve the application.

5. **Tools and Frameworks**:
   - Use libraries like LangChain to implement techniques such as:
     - **PAL** (Program-Aided Language Models).
     - **ReAct** (Reasoning and Action).
     - Chain of Thought prompting.
   - Model hubs enable centralized model management and sharing.

6. **User Interface and Security**:
   - A user-friendly interface (e.g., website or REST API) for application interaction.
   - Incorporate robust security for user interactions and data handling.
