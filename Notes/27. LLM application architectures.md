1. **Infrastructure Layer**:
   - Provides the foundation for compute, storage, and networking.
   - Can be on-premises or cloud-based (on-demand, pay-as-you-go).
   - Must be scalable to meet real-time or near-real-time inference needs.

2. **Language Models**:
   - Includes foundation models and task-specific fine-tuned models.
   - Deployed on suitable infrastructure tailored to your latency and resource needs.

3. **External Data Integration**:
   - Use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to fetch information from external sources.
   - Augments the model's static context window for more dynamic and relevant completions.

4. **Storage and Feedback Mechanisms**:
   - Capture and store session data for:
     - Contextual augmentation.
     - Fine-tuning, alignment, and evaluation.
   - Gather user feedback to iteratively improve the application.

5. **Tools and Frameworks**:
   - Use libraries like LangChain to implement techniques such as:
     - **PAL** (Program-Aided Language Models).
     - **ReAct** (Reasoning and Action).
     - Chain of Thought prompting.
   - Model hubs enable centralized model management and sharing.

6. **User Interface and Security**:
   - A user-friendly interface (e.g., website or REST API) for application interaction.
   - Incorporate robust security for user interactions and data handling.

# End-to-End Generative AI Applications
- Users (human or system) interact with the full stack, with the LLM acting as the reasoning engine.
- The model is just one part of the larger system that includes infrastructure, tools, and interfaces.

# Key Techniques for Productionalization

1. **Fine-Tuning with RLHF**:
   - Aligns models with human values (helpfulness, harmlessness, honesty).
   - Reduces toxicity and improves safety in production.
   - Leverages pre-existing RL reward models and alignment datasets.

2. **Inference Optimization**:
   - Techniques to reduce model size:
     - **Distillation**: Simplifies the model while preserving performance.
     - **Quantization**: Reduces numerical precision for efficiency.
     - **Pruning**: Removes redundant parameters.
   - Reduces hardware requirements for production deployment.

   3. **Structured Prompting and External Tools**:
   - Use frameworks to structure workflows and improve LLM performance.
   - Enable LLMs to act as a reasoning and action-planning engine.
