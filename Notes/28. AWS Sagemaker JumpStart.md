# Amazon SageMaker JumpStart Overview

## Purpose
- A model hub that simplifies deploying foundation models into production.
- Helps integrate LLMs into applications with minimal effort.
- Supports fine-tuning, deployment, and API creation.

## Components Covered
- **Infrastructure**: Provides GPU-backed instances for training and deployment.
- **Foundation Models**: Includes popular pre-trained models like Flan-T5.
- **Tools and Frameworks**: Integrates with Hugging Face, fine-tuning techniques, and hyperparameter optimization.
- **API**: Automatically deploys real-time persistent endpoints.

# Using SageMaker JumpStart

## Accessing JumpStart
- Navigate via AWS Console or SageMaker Studio.
- Choose "JumpStart" from the main screen or left-hand menu.

## Features
- **Foundation Models**: Includes models for various modalities (e.g., Flan-T5).
- **Variants**: Use different model versions (e.g., Base, Large) based on task complexity.
- **Integration with Hugging Face**: Deploy and fine-tune models seamlessly with a few clicks.

## Deployment
- Choose instance type and size for hosting the model.
- **Security Settings**: Configure controls to meet security requirements.
- Deploy models to real-time endpoints (persistent but cost-incurring).
- **Cost Tips**:
  - Refer to the SageMaker pricing page.
  - Delete endpoints when not in use to avoid unnecessary charges.

## Fine-Tuning
- Specify training and validation datasets.
- Adjust compute size via drop-down for cost optimization.
- Modify hyperparameters easily (e.g., PEFT techniques like LoRA).
- Initiate training jobs for task-specific fine-tuning.

## Programmatic Access
- Automatically generate notebooks for programmatic model management.
- Explore and modify the generated code for custom workflows.
