# ShopBot Example: Processing a Return Request

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Customer Request**
   - The customer expresses their intent to return a product (e.g., jeans).
   - ShopBot asks for the order number.

2. **Order Lookup**
   - ShopBot retrieves the order details from a transaction database.
   - Likely implemented with RAG using a SQL query rather than a document search.

3. **Confirmation**
   - ShopBot confirms if the customer wants to return any additional items.

4. **Return Label Request**
   - ShopBot sends a Python API request to the company's shipping partner for a return label.
   - The customer provides their email, which is included in the API call.

5. **Completion**
   - The bot emails the shipping label to the customer and ends the conversation.

# Key Features of LLM Application Integration

1. **Triggering Actions**
   - LLMs can initiate workflows by interacting with APIs, databases, or other applications.
   - **Examples**: Generating a SQL query, calling a Python API, or scheduling tasks.

2. **Reasoning Engine**
   - The LLM serves as the core decision-maker, generating actionable plans based on user inputs.

3. **Accurate Information Handling**
   - Collects and validates data required to complete actions (e.g., confirming order numbers or email addresses).

4. **Dynamic API Calls**
   - Generates calls tailored to the external systemâ€™s requirements (e.g., shipping label requests).

# Designing Effective Prompts and Completions

### Key Requirements for Success

1. **Actionable Instructions**
   - The LLM must produce clear steps that correspond to valid actions the system can execute.
   - **Example**: Retrieve order ID, request a shipping label, send a confirmation email.

2. **Structured Output**
   - Responses should be in a format easily understood by the application, such as:
     - **SQL Query**:
       ```sql
       SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_id = '12345';
       ```
     - **API Call**:
       ```json
       {
         "action": "request_label",
         "order_id": "12345",
         "email": "customer@example.com"
       }
       ```

3. **Validation Data**
   - Ensures the completion includes necessary details for verification (e.g., user email).

4. **Custom Prompt Engineering**
   - Properly structured prompts guide the LLM to generate accurate, actionable, and properly formatted outputs.
