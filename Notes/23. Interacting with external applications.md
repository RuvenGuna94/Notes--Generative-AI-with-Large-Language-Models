# ShopBot Example: Processing a Return Request

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Customer Request**
   - The customer expresses their intent to return a product (e.g., jeans).
   - ShopBot asks for the order number.

2. **Order Lookup**
   - ShopBot retrieves the order details from a transaction database.
   - Likely implemented with RAG using a SQL query rather than a document search.

3. **Confirmation**
   - ShopBot confirms if the customer wants to return any additional items.

4. **Return Label Request**
   - ShopBot sends a Python API request to the company's shipping partner for a return label.
   - The customer provides their email, which is included in the API call.

5. **Completion**
   - The bot emails the shipping label to the customer and ends the conversation.
