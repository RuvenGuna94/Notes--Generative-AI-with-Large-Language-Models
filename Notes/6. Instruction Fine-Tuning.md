# Instruction Fine-Tuning

- **Motivation**:
  - Smaller LLMs may fail at zero-shot inference (following instructions without examples).
  - Few-shot learning can be unreliable and limits context window size, reducing space for other useful information.
- **Fine-Tuning**:
  - Supervised learning process that updates LLM weights using labelled data.
  - Improves model performance on specific tasks.
- **Instruction Fine-Tuning Concept**: Trains the model on examples demonstrating how to respond to instructions.
- **Example**:
  - Instruction: "Classify this review."
  - Completion: "sentiment: positive"
- **Data Preparation**:
  - Create datasets with instructions and corresponding completions for the desired task (e.g., summarization, translation).
  - Utilize prompt template libraries to adapt existing datasets (e.g., Amazon reviews) for instruction-based fine-tuning.
