# Instruction Fine-Tuning

- **Motivation**:
  - Smaller LLMs may fail at zero-shot inference (following instructions without examples).
  - Few-shot learning can be unreliable and limits context window size, reducing space for other useful information.
- **Fine-Tuning**:
  - Supervised learning process that updates LLM weights using labelled data.
  - Improves model performance on specific tasks.
- **Instruction Fine-Tuning Concept**: Trains the model on examples demonstrating how to respond to instructions.
- **Example**:
  - Instruction: "Classify this review."
  - Completion: "sentiment: positive"
- **Data Preparation**:
  - Create datasets with instructions and corresponding completions for the desired task (e.g., summarization, translation).
  - Utilize prompt template libraries to adapt existing datasets (e.g., Amazon reviews) for instruction-based fine-tuning.

# Prompt Template Libraries

- **Purpose**:
  - Transform existing datasets (e.g., Amazon product reviews) into instruction-based datasets for fine-tuning.
- **Features**:
  - Contain pre-defined templates for various tasks (classification, text generation, summarization).
  - Support different datasets.
- **Example: Amazon Product Reviews**:
  - **Classification**:
    - Instruction: "Predict the associated rating for the following review: {review_body}"
  - **Text Generation**:
    - Instruction: "Generate a star review for the following product: {review_body}"
  - **Text Summarization**:
    - Instruction: "Give a short sentence describing the following product review: {review_body}"

# Fine-Tuning Process

- **Data Splitting**: Divide data into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Training**:
  - Feed prompts to the LLM.
  - Generate completions.
  - Calculate loss (e.g., cross-entropy) between LLM completion and ground truth.
  - Update model weights using backpropagation.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Monitor performance on validation set during training.
  - Evaluate final performance on the test set.

# Key Considerations

- **Computational Resources**: Full fine-tuning requires significant memory and compute resources.
- **Memory Optimization**: Utilize strategies learned in previous lessons (e.g., memory optimization, parallel computing).
- **Result**: Creates an "instruct model" specialized for the target tasks.

# Important Metrics

- Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, perplexity).
- Quantify improvement over the base model.
