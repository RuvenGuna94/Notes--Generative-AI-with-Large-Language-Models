# Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)

## Overview of PPO
- PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) is a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to optimize the behavior of models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), so that they align more closely with human preferences.
- Over many iterations, PPO ensures that updates made to the model weights are small, keeping them "proximal" (i.e., close to the original model), which stabilizes learning and prevents overshooting into unreliable areas.

## PPO Phases for LLM Alignment

### 1. Phase 1: Experiments
- The LLM is used to generate responses to a set of prompts. These responses are evaluated using a reward model, which measures alignment with human preferences (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness, honesty).
- The reward values help assess how well the model performs in accordance with human goals.

### 2. Phase 2: Updates
- After generating responses and calculating rewards, PPO updates the model's weights based on the feedback.
- The updates are done in small steps within a "trust region" to avoid drastic changes, ensuring stable training.
