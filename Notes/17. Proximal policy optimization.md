# Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)

## Overview of PPO
- PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) is a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to optimize the behavior of models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), so that they align more closely with human preferences.
- Over many iterations, PPO ensures that updates made to the model weights are small, keeping them "proximal" (i.e., close to the original model), which stabilizes learning and prevents overshooting into unreliable areas.
