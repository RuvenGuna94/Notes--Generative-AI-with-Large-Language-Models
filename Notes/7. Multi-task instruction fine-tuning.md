# Multitask Fine-Tuning

- **Concept**: Trains the model on a dataset containing examples for multiple tasks (e.g., summarization, translation, entity recognition).
- **Benefits**:
  - Improves performance across multiple tasks simultaneously.
  - Helps avoid catastrophic forgetting (degradation of performance on other tasks during single-task fine-tuning).
- **Drawbacks**:
  - Requires a large amount of data (50-100,000 examples).
