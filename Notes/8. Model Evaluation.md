# Introduction
- **Challenge**: 
  - Evaluating LLM performance is complex due to the non-deterministic nature of language and the subjective quality of outputs.
- **Need for Metrics**: 
  - Quantify model performance and compare different models.

# Traditional Machine Learning vs. LLMs
- **Traditional ML**: 
  - Clear ground truth, deterministic outputs.
  - Simple metrics like accuracy are sufficient.
- **LLMs**: 
  - Non-deterministic outputs, subjective quality.
  - Requires more sophisticated evaluation methods.
