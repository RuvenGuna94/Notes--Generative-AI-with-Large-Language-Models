# The Problem: LLMs and Arithmetic Limitations

While LLMs excel in many tasks, their ability to handle arithmetic and complex mathematical operations is limited because they don't actually "do math." Instead, they predict the most likely sequence of tokens based on training data.  
These errors can cause significant issues, such as incorrect pricing, flawed measurements, or invalid business insights.

# Solution: PAL Framework

Program-Aided Language Models (PAL) integrate an LLM with a Python interpreter (or another external tool) to ensure accurate calculations. Developed by Luyu Gao and collaborators at Carnegie Mellon University in 2022, PAL leverages Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting to guide the LLM to generate Python scripts for solving problems.
