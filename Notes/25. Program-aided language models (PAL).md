# The Problem: LLMs and Arithmetic Limitations

While LLMs excel in many tasks, their ability to handle arithmetic and complex mathematical operations is limited because they don't actually "do math." Instead, they predict the most likely sequence of tokens based on training data.  
These errors can cause significant issues, such as incorrect pricing, flawed measurements, or invalid business insights.

# Solution: PAL Framework

Program-Aided Language Models (PAL) integrate an LLM with a Python interpreter (or another external tool) to ensure accurate calculations. Developed by Luyu Gao and collaborators at Carnegie Mellon University in 2022, PAL leverages Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting to guide the LLM to generate Python scripts for solving problems.

### How PAL Works

1. **Structure the Prompt**  
   - Include a one-shot example with reasoning steps and corresponding Python code.  
   - **Example:**  
     
     **Problem:** Roger buys tennis balls.  
     - **Reasoning (Blue):**  
       - Roger starts with 5 balls.  
       - He buys 2 cans of balls, each containing 3 balls.  
       - Add 6 (from cans) to the 5 he already has.  
     - **Code (Pink):**  
       ```python
       # Roger starts with 5 balls
       balls_initial = 5
       # Each can has 3 balls; he buys 2 cans
       balls_new = 2 * 3
       # Total number of balls
       total_balls = balls_initial + balls_new
       total_balls
       ```
2. **Input the New Problem**  
   Add the problem you want solved at the end of the prompt. For example:  
   **New Problem:** The bakery starts with 120 loaves, sells 25 in the morning, 30 in the afternoon, and receives 9 back. How many loaves are left?  

3. **LLM Generates Python Script**  
   The LLM writes the script based on the example.  
   ```python
   # Starting number of loaves
   loaves_start = 120
   # Loaves sold in the morning and afternoon
   loaves_sold = 25 + 30
   # Loaves returned from the grocery store
   loaves_returned = 9
   # Remaining loaves
   loaves_left = loaves_start - loaves_sold + loaves_returned
   loaves_left
   ```

4. **Pass the Script to an Interpreter**  
   Use a Python interpreter to execute the code.  
   - **Result:** The calculation shows 74 loaves remaining.

5. **Return the Answer**  
   Append the accurate answer back into the prompt for further use or display.
