# The Problem: LLMs and Arithmetic Limitations

While LLMs excel in many tasks, their ability to handle arithmetic and complex mathematical operations is limited because they don't actually "do math." Instead, they predict the most likely sequence of tokens based on training data.  
These errors can cause significant issues, such as incorrect pricing, flawed measurements, or invalid business insights.
