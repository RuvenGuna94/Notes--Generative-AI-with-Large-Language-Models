# Chain of Thought Prompting

Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting is a method where the model is guided to solve problems by reasoning step-by-step, similar to how a human would approach them.

# How It Works

### 1. Include a One-Shot Example
- Provide an example problem with intermediate reasoning steps and a solution.
- **Example:**
  - **Problem**: How many tennis balls does Roger have after buying some new ones?
  - **Solution (broken into steps)**:
    1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.
    2. He buys 2 cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 balls, so he gets 6 new balls.
    3. Add 6 to the original 5, for a total of 11.
    4. **Answer**: Roger has 11 tennis balls.

### 2. Apply the Chain of Thought to the Task
- Structure the example in a way that the model mimics it for solving the actual problem.

# Reworked Example with CoT Prompting

**Problem**: The cafeteria had 13 apples. It used 7 to make lunch and bought 3 more. How many apples are left?

**Steps**:
- The cafeteria starts with 13 apples.
- It uses 7 apples for lunch, leaving 13 - 7 = 6 apples.
- It then buys 3 more apples, adding to the 6.
- 6 + 3 = 9 apples.

**Answer**: The cafeteria has 9 apples.

**LLM's New Answer**: 9 (Correct)
