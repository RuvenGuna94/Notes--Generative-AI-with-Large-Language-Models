# How It Works

### 1. Include a One-Shot Example
- Provide an example problem with intermediate reasoning steps and a solution.
- **Example:**
  - **Problem**: How many tennis balls does Roger have after buying some new ones?
  - **Solution (broken into steps)**:
    1. Roger starts with 5 tennis balls.
    2. He buys 2 cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 balls, so he gets 6 new balls.
    3. Add 6 to the original 5, for a total of 11.
    4. **Answer**: Roger has 11 tennis balls.
