# Pre-Training a Large Language Model (LLM)

## Key Characteristics
- Most complex stage.
- Involves model architecture decisions, extensive training data, and high expertise.

## Relevance
- Generally skipped when starting with a foundation model.

# Performance Assessment

## Prompt Engineering
- Requires minimal technical expertise.
- No additional model training needed.

## Use Case
- Assess and refine the model's performance without heavy resource investment.

# Model Tuning

## Fine-Tuning Methods
- **Full Fine-Tuning**: Adjusts all parameters for the specific use case.
- **Parameter-Efficient Techniques** (e.g., LoRA, Prompt Tuning): Focuses on a smaller set of parameters to save compute and time.

## Effort and Expertise
- Requires some technical expertise.
- Often successful with a small training dataset.
- Can potentially be completed in a day.

# Model Alignment

## Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
- Aligns the model with human preferences.
- Can be quick if an existing reward model is used.

## Training a Reward Model
- Time-intensive due to the effort required to gather human feedback.

# Model Optimization

## Complexity
- Falls in the middle in terms of effort and complexity.

## Effort
- Proceeds quickly if optimizations don't negatively impact performance.

# Deployment Readiness

## Final Model
- A fine-tuned, aligned, and optimized LLM tailored for the use case.
- Ready for deployment after addressing potential performance issues.
