# Program-Aided Language Models (PAL)
- **Purpose**: Handles arithmetic and mathematical operations by pairing LLMs with external interpreters (like Python).
- **Mechanism**:
  - The LLM generates Python scripts as part of its reasoning process.
  - These scripts are executed by an external Python interpreter for accuracy.
  - Results are fed back into the prompt for further reasoning or final answers.
- **Benefits**: Ensures correctness in calculations, even with complex math tasks, while relying on the LLM for reasoning.
