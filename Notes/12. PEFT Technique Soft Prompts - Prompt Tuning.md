# Introduction
- **Goal**: Improve model performance without altering the original model weights.
- **Contrast with Prompt Engineering**:
  - **Prompt Engineering**:
    - Manually crafting prompts to guide the model.
    - Can be time-consuming and may not always achieve desired results.
  - **Prompt Tuning**:
    - Adds trainable "soft prompts" to the input.
    - Leverages supervised learning to optimize the soft prompts for the specific task.
