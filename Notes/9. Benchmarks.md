- Evaluate LLM performance across various tasks.  
- Compare different models. 
- Drive research and development of more capable models.

## Key Benchmarks

### GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation)
- Collection of diverse NLP tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis, question-answering).  
- Designed to encourage development of general-purpose models.  

### SuperGLUE
- Successor to GLUE with more challenging tasks.  
- Includes multi-sentence reasoning and more difficult versions of GLUE tasks.  

### MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)
- Focuses on broad world knowledge and problem-solving abilities.  
- Includes tasks in math, US history, computer science, law, and more.  

### BIG-bench
- Comprehensive benchmark with 204 tasks across various domains (e.g., linguistics, childhood development, math, common sense, biology, physics, social bias, software development).  
- Available in different sizes to manage computational costs.  

### HELM (Holistic Evaluation of Language Models)
- **Key Features:**  
  - **Multimetric approach:** Evaluates beyond accuracy (e.g., fairness, bias, toxicity).  
  - **Transparency:** Aims to provide clear insights into model strengths and weaknesses.  
  - **Evolving framework:** Continuously updated with new scenarios, metrics, and models.

## Importance of Benchmarks

### Drive Research
- Encourage the development of more robust and capable LLMs.  
- Identify areas for improvement in model architecture and training methods.  

### Model Comparison
- Enable objective evaluation and comparison of different models.  

### Identify Limitations
- Highlight areas where LLMs still fall short of human capabilities.
